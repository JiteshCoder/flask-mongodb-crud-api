# flask-mongodb-crud-api
This project is a simple REST API built with Flask and MongoDB. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. This API can serve as a starting point for more complex applications and provides a foundation for integrating MongoDB with a Flask web server.
